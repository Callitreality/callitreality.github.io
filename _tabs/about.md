### Hello!

So... you have found your way here.  
A little about me... My name is Alexander, but I go by Alex or Kali (Military and Friend nickname). I love all things technical and mechanical. I started at a young age taking computers apart. This turned into me experimenting with small engines on motorcycles, then moving up to V10s and some V12s.  

Music is something that runs deep within my personality. I mainly listen to a bunch of EDM (Above & Beyond, Edward Maya, Eric Prydz, and Jacob Plant, to name a few...). I do dabble in other genres as I am usually open to listening to them. Country is my least favorite genre unless it is old school.

I graduated from the University of Nebraska - Omaha with a bachelors in Cyber Security and a minor in Computer Science and French. I currently know 5 languages (French, Russian, German, Romanian, and English), but not fluent within speaking 4 of them. I can decently read and write them.

Stick around to learn more about what I want to do :smile:
