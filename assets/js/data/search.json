Starting with “hacking”, I want to try to load Kali Linux (a popular flavor of Linux) onto the Steam Deck and see if I can get it to work. If so, I want to know what the potential it has in store when it comes to breaching security measures using the system. I would also like to see if emulators can be ran fully on a steam deck without any problems as well as to see if the controllers related to the games themselves can be used virtually. I would also like to see if the Steam Deck can be used as a virtual machine.Specs of the Steam Deck Processor AMD APU CPU: Zen 2 4c/8t, 2.4-3.5GHz (up to 448 GFlops FP32) GPU: 8 RDNA 2 CUs, 1.0-1.6GHz (up to 1.6 TFlops FP32) APU power: 4-15W RAM 16 GB LPDDR5 on-board RAM (5500 MT/s quad 32-bit channels) Storage 512 GB high-speed NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*) Display 1280 x 800px (16:10 aspect ratio) Optically bonded IPS LCD for enhanced readability Screen Size - 7” diagonal Brightness - 400 nits typical Refresh Rate - 60Hz Touch Enabled - Yes Sensor - Ambient light sensor Connectivity Bluetooth 5.0 Wifi - Dual-band Wi-Fi radio, 2.4GHz and 5GHz, 2 x 2 MIMO, IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Expansion microSD - UHS-I supports SD, SDXC and SDHC USB-C with DisplayPort 1.4 Alt-mode support; up to 8K @60Hz or 4K @120Hz, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Software SteamOS 3.0 (Arch-based) New song to listen to:Revision 0.1 - 7/26/2022: Initial UploadRevision 0.2 - 7/26/2022: Grammatical Mistakes" }, { "title": "Reddit Bot: Scraping Subthreads", "url": "/posts/Reddit-Bot/", "categories": "Reddit-Bot", "tags": "Reddit, Bot", "date": "2022-07-04 19:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Details Details Details…To explain why I am even talking about this is because one day I got miffed that I could not get an invite for something I wanted on a subreddit of Reddit. I wanted to know when someone was to make a post, and I could connect it via keywords. At that point in time, the bot would notify me via SMS. That is the plan at least.This bot was designed to scrape any subreddit someone designates. Searching for keywords in the titles, to searching for keywords in the descriptions.Packages NeededPython 3.10.X was used for this projectPython Dotenv is used to store the bot’s credentials. - pip install python-dotenvPRAW is used to interact with the Reddit API. - pip install prawIncase anything goes wrong, uninstall all the libraries (including the ones not in this project) with: pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -yDescriptionThe python-dotenv package is for the user to create their own .env file that allows for variables to be hidden when they push anything up to a repository. This is only if they have a .gitignore file that is custom or premade.The praw is the Python Reddit API Wrapper package that allows the bot communicate with Reddit services/servers. More documentation about it can be explained here: PRAW.The Code Itself (Work In Progress)This is the structure to what you, as a reader, will want to base yours off of. I will be updating this slowly as I work on it. I would like to make it more customized and user friendly when it comes to CLI (Command Line Interface).NotesIn the code provided below, there is a variable like &quot;{BOT-NAME-HERE}&quot;. The maker of the bot will need to replace that with their bot’s name.

Proxmox in its essence is an open-source plateform that allows the virtualization of any (if not, most) operating systems. The virtualization of them are called VMs (virtual machines), and also supports containers (like VMs but more lightweight).In all honesty, it is an alright hypervisor (general software that allows virtualization). I prefer VMware’s ESXi honestly since it is more robust and allows for greater features in my perspective. Then again, Proxmox is completely new to me.Actual ProblemI am having a very hard time wrapping my head around the GUI (Graphical User Interface, basically a “website” that you access through an IP). It doesn’t seem that complicated but it still is. I don’t necessarily like it honestly. It is so far out of my stretch and I am thinking of transferring back to ESXi. I know that Proxmox itself uses less system resources than ESXi since it is open source; this also means it requires less resourcesI am unsure at this point in time how I can get used to the GUI. There are other things that took me awhile to understand in the first place like how to make a storage pool to hold data in. I had no idea that my SSDs that I had in the server were already formatted in ZFS (type of filesystem format). I then formatted them and cleared them of the ZFS it was set with. I was then able to make a pool.Okay… Actual Problem AgainThe actual problem now is the fact I cannot spin up a VM without messing up the IP addresses and trying to connect it to the internet.What I Understand &amp;amp; The PlanWhat I want to do with Proxmox is run 2 VMs to run multiple services on. One VM will be designated for internal services that do not need to be reached from the outside (but may still have internet connection, still unsure about this), and external services (websites, VPNs, and other stuff). These “services” will be set up in the VMs as Docker Containers (I am not explaining, it is a ton of information already). Those containers will house everything, and I personally have to get better at networking when it comes to that. I need more experience within virtual networking and phyiscial networking.New song to listen to:Honestly love this song, listen to it whenever I am hacking anything. Think of it as a pump up song.

This would be localized to my network. I can have a VPN client on the RPi Zero which I can have a VPN server at my house then! This means from anywhere in the world, as long as I have Wi-Fi I can immediately boot the PCs/Servers/IoT devices.OutlineExplaination of the overall goal. Interface Scroll menu - Allows for quick access for selection of any device. Wi-Fi - allows for either checking to see if it is connected to the internet, or allows for the user to answer the password (can be tasking…). VPN selection/connection - Allows for the user to immediately connect to VPN server at home and checks connection. May want Python to be the driver behind this.

Storage of the information of the IP addresses and MAC addresses could be difficult. It could be in a file which we just parse it out, or just straight hard-coded (which is not a good idea if I want this to be secure). Either with the OLED Screen or the TFT screen, this can be accomplished. I would prefer the TFT screen mainly on the fact that it is color, and the fact that it is square which would make the design of this more simple.It is also a very good idea to try and make this a password protected so that if it timed out, you would have to input a specific combination to gain access to the program. I am thinking roughly 30 seconds of timeout is a good space to do so.Another thing is, if this is going to be portable, I am thinking of incorporating a battery into it and a battery meter as well. I believe that would be more liking as I wouldn’t have to carry a battery pack and try to convert it for the usage itself. I will just have to take into account on how much power everything will draw. I will have to make a dedicated sleep function as well to make sure that usage of power is minimal.New song to listen to:Revision 0.1 - 6/17/2022: Initial UploadRevision 0. - 6/1/2022: Minor change of Title" }, { "title": "Homelab: Updating the BIOS &amp; iDRAC on R630/R730 series Servers", "url": "/posts/Rx30-BIOS-iDRAC/", "categories": "Homelab", "tags": "Homelab, R630, R730, R730XD, iDRAC, BIOS", "date": "2022-06-14 11:00:00 -0600", "snippet": "Updating the BIOS &amp;amp; iDRAC on RX30 Series ServerNote: I cried during this whole process, this documentation is to help you cry less than I did. Requirements: Need to plug in RX30 Make sure there is an ethernet cable plugged into the iDRAC port Must have PC to download firmware (Doesn’t matter what Operating System, recommended is Windows) Banana for potassium 🍌 First, you will want to pull the drivers off of Dell’s Website. You will specifically be looking for BIOS 2.13.0 and iDRAC version 2.83.83.83.BIOSiDRACAfter DownloadingYou will want to create a “dump” folder for the iDRAC executable. Most likely, you are in your downloads folder. If you would like to stay in there, that is fine. I do recommend though of moving both .exe files to a separate folder (I called mine ‘Dell’ originally).Make another new folder called ‘iDRAC_dump’. Click on the iDRAC-with-Lifecycle-Controller_Firmware---.exe executable. You should see something similar to this…You will want to click on ‘extract’ and extract the files to the ‘iDRAC_dump’ folder (you will want to create one). Once in there you will see a folder called ‘payload’, within that folder you will see a file called firmimg.d7. That file is the firmware file you will need for the next step.iDRACYou will head to the iDRAC hosted site using the IP address of the iDRAC card. You can usually find this within your router’s IP table. Heading to the page, you will need to put in the Username and Password of the iDRAC. Once you are in, you will see a page like this:In the green box is the current version I have loaded onto the R630 for BIOS and iDRAC, we will be getting you there shortly. In the meantime, click ‘Update and Rollback’ (shown with the red box around it).UploadingiDRAC UploadThe page is pretty simple, by default it is on the ‘Update’ tab. You will want to click on ‘Choose File’ and input the path for that firmimg.d7 file mentioned earlier. After that you will want to click ‘upload’. From there you will be moved to another page in which it will show that it is loading the firmware. This can definitely take some time. Once it is done installing the firmware, the RX30 will restart and thus kick you out of the iDRAC management page.Hit the refresh button and log back into the page. Depending on what firmware version you had before, you will notice some very heavy changes. You will then navigate back to ‘Update and Rollback’ to then upload the BIOS.BIOS UploadWithin the ‘Update and Rollback’ page again, you will upload the file named BIOS_74DF9_WN64_2.13.0.EXE. You do not have to extract the file and pull the firmware, just upload the entire .exe file. This will take some time again with a restart at the finish.FinishedYou can now thank yourself that you were able to get this done with minimal tears. Go and do it to the rest of your servers, and cry less.New song to listen to:Revision 0.1 - 6/15/2022: Initial UploadRevision 0.2 - 6/16/2022: Grammar, and rewording thingsRevision 0.3 - 7/26/2022: Resizing Spotify iframe" }, { "title": "Driven", "url": "/posts/driven/", "categories": "Finance", "tags": "", "date": "2022-06-12 22:59:00 -0600", "snippet": "I have no idea what the hell I am doing…I realized I have a problem. My problem being is that I want to make money, and make it quickly. I want to be able to topple the status I currently hold.I come from a poor background; nothing against my family, but money has always been a struggle to say the least. This has driven me further beyond my threshold as everything I want in life to be accomplished. When people say, “Money does not buy you happiness…” are usually the ones that forget that a dollar difference can be life or death of someone. The (most) people that tend to grow up with wealth tend to be the people that do not understand hardships. Yes, some of them may have had parents that have had been through hard times, but the person themselves do not understand what it means to skip a few meals just to make it by.Rant overAlright, lets get to the meat and potatoes of this.

The good thing is though is that I am actually going to be paid pretty well when moving to the new location, so I am not worried right now at all about expenses or anything really.PicturesWhen I am there, I plan on taking as many pictures as I can to at least show what is going on. I am also thinking of showing off the apartments that I am looking at and the spreadsheet for them. Wouldn’t be a bad idea right? At least it would show you guys that it is somewhat decent where I am going to be at.Moving time..?I haven’t let many people know when I am moving (or even where I am moving to for multiple reasons).

I am still looking forward to it though as this will eventually put me in a better place for my career and life.Ideas On ActivitiesAt this new location, I will be getting a new snowboard and hopefully be active with it enough to start a youtube channel. My end goal before I move again (approximately a year from now) is to rent a helicopter and fly to the summit of the mountain. At that point I will just drop off the helicopter and snowboard down the mountain. Most people that know me will definitely say I am an adrenaline junkie that loves to go fast. Which to a certain degree, they are not wrong.Goals Within My CareerWhen I finally get settled, I will start going after certifications. I would like to branch off from Software Engineering and go straight into my career field which is Cyber Security. With the program I am on, I will switch from SW to Cyber in about a year. Hopefully at that point in time I will be able to move as well to a different location.My New Idea…With moving to a new location, I am thinking of starting a YouTube channel about pen-testing networks and PCs. I may branch out a little and decide further down the line of what I actually want to make videos about. This will suck all the time I have from my life but in the end run, it will be worth it.
