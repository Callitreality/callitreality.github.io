# This is going to be the most painstaking part... the drive...

So... Most of you that will see this already know I drive an expensive car. Most of you know that I cry when there is high miliage on said car ðŸ˜‚. I am looking forward to the trip, but also not looking forward to the amount of $ I will be dropping. The good thing is though is that I am actually going to be paid pretty well when moving to the new location, so I am not worried right now at all about expenses or anything really.

## Pictures
When I am there, I plan on taking as many pictures as I can to at least show what is going on. I am also thinking of showing off the apartments that I am looking at and the spreadsheet for them. Wouldn't be a bad idea right? At least it would show you guys that it is somewhat decent where I am going to be at.

## Moving time..?
I haven't let many people know when I am moving (or even where I am moving to for multiple reasons). This is going to stay that way for the time being at least until I feel comfortable that I have made a good, solid group of friends. I still plan on keeping in contact with my friends where I am currently living, but would at least like to get my life in order.

### _Side Notes_
I have been thinking of actually posting some music on every post, just to kind've give you (the poor readers of my bullsh*t) a taste of my music.

You will need a spotify account to listen directly on here, if you are interested in listening still, I recommend YouTube (click the picture below ðŸ‘‡)
